# Installing with GIT

This installs and runs Evennia from its sources. This is required if you want to contribute to Evennia itself or have an easier time exploring the code. See the basic [Installation](./Installation.md) for
a quick installation of the library. See the [troubleshooting](./Installation-Troubleshooting.md) if you run
into trouble.

```{important}
If you are converting an existing game from a previous version, [see here](./Installation-Upgrade.md).
```

## Summary

For the impatient. If you have trouble with a step, you should jump on to the
more detailed instructions for your platform.

```{warning}
Currently, these instructions will install 'latest' (stable) Evennia, which is
the 0.9.5 version. To install 1.0-dev, you need to add a step `git checkout develop` between steps
3 and 4 below.
```

1. Install Python and GIT. Start a Console/Terminal.
2. `cd` to some place you want to do your development (like a folder
   `/home/anna/muddev/` on Linux or a folder in your personal user directory on Windows).
3. `git clone https://github.com/evennia/evennia.git`  (a new folder `evennia` is created)
4. `python3.11 -m venv evenv`  (a new folder `evenv` is created)
5. `source evenv/bin/activate` (Linux, Mac), `evenv\Scripts\activate` (Windows)
6. `pip install -e evennia`
7. `evennia --init mygame`
8. `cd mygame`
9. `evennia migrate`
10. `evennia start` (make sure to make a  superuser when asked)

Evennia should now be running and you can connect to it by pointing a web browser to
`http://localhost:4001` or a MUD telnet client to `localhost:4000` (use `127.0.0.1` if your OS does
not recognize `localhost`).

## Virtualenv 

A Python [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) allows you to install Evennia in its own little folder, separate from the rest of the system. You also won't need any extra permissions. It's optional to use a virtualenv, but it's highly recommended. Python supports this natively: 

     python3.11 -m venv evenv   (linux/mac)
	 python -m venv venv evenv  (Windows)

 > If you have older versions of Python installed on Windows, you should instead use `py` instead of `python` - the `py` launcher automatically selects the latest python version among those you installed.

This will create a new folder `evenv` in your current directory. 
Activate it like this: 

`source evenv/bin/activate` (Linux, Mac)
`evenv\Scripts\activate` (Windows)
`.\evenv\scripts\activate` (Windows with PS Shell, Git Bash etc)

The text `(evenv)` should appear next to your prompt to show that the virtual
environment is active. You _don't_ need to actually be in or near the `evenv` folder for 
the environment to be active.

> Remember that you need to re-activate the virtualenv like this *every time* you
> start a new terminal/console. Otherwise the `evennia` command will not be available.

## Linux Install

For Debian-derived systems (like Ubuntu, Mint etc), start a terminal and
install the requirements:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev gcc
```
You should make sure to *not* be `root` after this step, running as `root` is a
security risk. Now create a folder where you want to do all your Evennia
development:

```
mkdir muddev
cd muddev
```

Next we fetch Evennia itself:

```
git clone https://github.com/evennia/evennia.git
```
A new folder `evennia` will appear containing the Evennia library. This only
contains the source code though, it is not *installed* yet. 

At this point it's now optional but recommended that you initialize and activate a [virtualenv](#virtualenv). 

Next, install Evennia (system-wide, or into your active virtualenv). Make sure you are standing
at the top of your mud directory tree (so you see the `evennia/` folder, and likely the `evenv` virtualenv folder) and do

```
pip install -e evennia
```

Test that you can run the `evennia` command.

Next you can continue initializing your game from the regular [Installation instructions](./Installation.md).


## Mac Install

The Evennia server is a terminal program. Open the terminal e.g. from
*Applications->Utilities->Terminal*. [Here is an introduction to the Mac
terminal](https://blog.teamtreehouse.com/introduction-to-the-mac-os-x-command-line)
if you are unsure how it works.

* Python should already be installed but you must make sure it's a high enough version - go for
 3.11.
([This](https://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/osx/) discusses how you may upgrade it).
* GIT can be obtained with
[git-osx-installer](https://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer/) or via MacPorts [as described
here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Installing-Git#Installing-on-Mac).
* If you run into issues with installing `Twisted` later you may need to
install gcc and the Python headers.

After this point you should not need `sudo` or any higher privileges to install anything.

Now create a folder where you want to do all your Evennia development:

```
mkdir muddev
cd muddev
```

Next we fetch Evennia itself:

```
git clone https://github.com/evennia/evennia.git
```

A new folder `evennia` will appear containing the Evennia library. This only
contains the source code though, it is not *installed* yet. 

At this point it's now optional but recommended that you initialize and activate a [virtualenv](#virtualenv). 

Next, install Evennia (system-wide, or into your active virtualenv). Make sure you are standing
at the top of your mud directory tree (so you see the `evennia/`, and likely the `evenv` virtualenv 
folder) and do

```
pip install --upgrade pip   # Old pip versions may be an issue on Mac.
pip install --upgrade setuptools   # Ditto concerning Mac issues.
pip install -e evennia
```

Test that you can run the `evennia` command. 

Next you can continue initializing your game from the regular [Installation instructions](./Installation.md).

## Windows Install

> If you are running Windows10+, consider using the _Windows Subsystem for Linux_
> ([WSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux)) instead. Just set up WSL with an Ubuntu image and follow the Linux install instructions above.

The Evennia server itself is a command line program. In the Windows launch
menu, start *All Programs -> Accessories -> command prompt* and you will get
the Windows command line interface. Here is [one of many tutorials on using the Windows command line](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/windows-command-prompt-introduction/) if you are unfamiliar with it.

* Install Python [from the Python homepage](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/). You will need to be a
Windows Administrator to install packages. Get Python **3.11**, usually
the 64-bit version (although it doesn't matter too much). **When installing, make sure
to check-mark *all* install options, especially the one about making Python
available on the path (you may have to scroll to see it)**. This allows you to
just write `python` (or possibly `py`) in any console without first finding where the `python`
program actually sits on your hard drive.
* You need to also get [GIT](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and install it. You can use the default install options but when you get asked to "Adjust your PATH environment", you should select the second option "Use Git from the Windows Command Prompt", which gives you more freedom as to where you can use the program.
* Finally you must install the [Microsoft Visual C++ compiler for Python](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vs_buildtools.exe). Download and run the linked installer and install the C++ tools. Keep all the defaults. Allow the install of the "Win10 SDK", even if you are on Win7 (not tested on older Windows versions). If you later have issues with installing Evennia due to a failure to build the "Twisted wheels", this is where you are missing things. 
* You *may* need the [pypiwin32](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pypiwin32) Python headers. Install these only if you have issues.

You can install Evennia wherever you want. `cd` to that location and create a
new folder for all your Evennia development (let's call it `muddev`).

```
mkdir muddev
cd muddev
```

> If `cd` isn't working you can use `pushd` instead to force the directory change.

Next we fetch Evennia itself:

```
git clone https://github.com/evennia/evennia.git
```

A new folder `evennia` will appear containing the Evennia library. This only
contains the source code though, it is not *installed* yet. 

At this point it's optional but recommended that you initialize and activate a [virtualenv](#virtualenv). 

Next, install Evennia (system wide, or into the virtualenv). Make sure you are standing
at the top of your mud directory tree (so you see `evennia`, and likely the `evenv`  virtualenv folder when running the `dir` command). Then do: 

```
pip install -e evennia
```

Test that you can run the `evennia` command everywhere while your virtualenv (evenv) is active.

Next you can continue initializing your game from the regular [Installation instructions](./Installation.md).
